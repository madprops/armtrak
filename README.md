Armtrak is a simple multiplayer space shooting game I made as an experiment, it took me less than a week to do. It's based on node.js and easeljs. Basically you pick a name and start shooting other ships to destroy them. It has a chat area at the right which also displays game notifications. There's a minimap that shows the location of ships. You warp to the other side of the map when you reach an edge. There are sound effects and explosion sprites.
