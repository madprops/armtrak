Armtrak is a simple multiplayer space shooting game I made as an experiment. It's based on node.js and easeljs. Basically you pick a name and start shooting other ships to destroy them. It has a chat area at the right which also displays game notifications. The player's name is shown beneath the ship. There's a minimap that shows the location of ships. You warp to the other side of the map when you reach an edge. There are sound effects and explosion sprites. If youtube video links are posted in the chat or you search for a video with ".yt some song", the video audio sounds in the background. Sound can be toggled on and off.
