Armtrak is a multiplayer space shooting game. It's based on node.js and easeljs. Basically you pick a name and start shooting other ships to destroy them. You will get a random ship out of 15 ships. At the beggining your ship starts with low stats (health, max speed and laser level) but you can increase them by destroying other ships. Everytime you destroy a ship, one of those three stats is increased at random. If you are destroyed you will return to the original stats. It has a chat area at the right which also displays game notifications. The player's name is shown beneath the ship. There's a minimap that shows the location of ships. You warp to the other side of the map when you reach an edge. There are sound effects and explosion sprites. If youtube video links are posted in the chat or you search for a video with "yt some song", the video audio sounds in the background for everyone. Sound can be toggled on and off. There's a hud on top which shows the current stats. You restore one hit of health when destroying another ship. You can place images on the map by pasting an image url. There's a 'safe zone' in the middle of the map and you can't receive damage when in there.
